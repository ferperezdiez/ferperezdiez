## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fernando Perez Diez, Full Stack Web Developer from Argentina. 

### I enjoy learning new things, checking my preconceptions and change my mind if needed. I am not afraid of the challenges or the uncertainty that everything new brings. I believe effort, perseverance, empathy, creativity and, fundamentally, teamwork, are essential elements to achieve the goals.
### As of today, I am currently skilled on: the following programming languages: Javascript, React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Postgresql and I am starting to internalize myself in Typescript as well. I feel comfortable both in Backend and Frontend, especially in those tasks that involve the use of the logical thinking.
